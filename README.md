# Overview
This is the documentation repository for the clustering algorithm of the paper "Interpretable Clustering: An Optimization Approach" by Dimitris Bertsimas, Agni Orfanoudaki, and Holly Wiberg. The purpose of this method, ICOT, is to generate interpretable tree-based clustering models. This code is compatible with Julia version 1.1.0, available for download [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/).

#Academic License and Installation
The ICOT software package uses tools from the [Interpretable AI](https://www.interpretable.ai/) suite and thus it requires an academic license. You can request an academic license by emailing <info@interpretable.ai> with your academic institution address.

Our code runs using 


You must obtain an academic license and precompiled Julia system image in order to install and run the ICOT software package. Please email {agniorf,cpawlows}@mit.edu with the subject line "Request for MedImpute License" in order to request access.


#Citing ICOT
If you use ICOT in your research, we kindly ask that you reference the original [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-020-05896-2) that first introduced the algorithm:
